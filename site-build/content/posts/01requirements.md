### Python experience
This workshop aims to be as inclusive as possible, but to get the most out of it you should have some Python experience. To engage with the practical tasks and build your own platform with Streamlit you should 
* have experience of the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library
* be familiar with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
* be comfortable using the [command line](https://alleetanner.github.io/intro-to-command-line/).

We will recap concepts like `import`ing, creating functions using `def`, and how to interact with a dataframe. Streamlit encourages a "linear" coding style, and uses the Pandas dataframe as a foundation.sdfio no

### Installing required software
